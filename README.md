# NEXT VR Headset Website

## Description

To reintroduce myself to the world of Front End Development, I followed a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FazgJVnrVuI) via YouTube. This project has allowed me to use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing website. My goal with this website was to refresh my understanding of code and push myself to use concepts that I previously worked on. 

This page includes hover animations and a mobile responsive design that shows a navigation menu as the screen size decreases.
